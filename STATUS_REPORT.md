## ðŸ”§ RECENT FIXES APPLIED

1. **Terminology Consistency**: Updated all references to use "Company Knowledge Base" instead of mixed terms
2. **Import Updates**: Fixed deprecation warnings by using langchain_ollama imports
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout the pipeline
4. **Model Configuration**: Optimized for llama3.2:1b (fastest available model)
5. **Response Generation**: Implemented streaming with fallback mechanisms

## ðŸ“‹ TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Upload Test Document**: Use the provided test_document.txt to verify file processing
2. **Test Queries**: 
   - "What are the key features of this RAG system?"
   - "Which model is being used?"
   - "What database is used for vector storage?"
3. **Multi-Document Test**: Upload multiple files and verify prioritization logic
4. **Chat History**: Verify conversation context is maintained across queries
